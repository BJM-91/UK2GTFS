# UK2GTFS

The goal of UK2GTFS is to convert train, tram, bus, and metro timetable data from the unfriendly and difficult to use formats used in the UK to the easy to use [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) format. For a full explanation see the getting started vignette.

## Installation

Install the package with **devtools** as follows:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # If you do not already have the devtools package
devtools::install_github("ITSleeds/UK2GTFS")
```

## Package Status

This package a work in progress and comes with no guarantees. As of September 2019, it can convert most train and bus timetables to GTFS but occasionally fails on specific files.
